Chapter 1 | Manifesto

The AEP protocol is built on a long-ignored yet undeniably real fact: life is not separate. You are me, and I am you; your happiness becomes my happiness, and your pain becomes my pain.

The next stage of human civilization should no longer revolve around “survival competition” and “scarcity anxiety.” Instead, it should move toward a more mature goal: with survival guaranteed, allow life to freely explore, to fail, to bloom, and to evolve.

AEP does not pursue a society with zero mistakes. On the contrary, it explicitly acknowledges:

Individuals will make mistakes

Collectives will misjudge

Exploration inevitably carries risks

Therefore, the aim of this protocol is not to “eliminate failure,” but to build a civilizational system that permits failure, can repair, and continues learning.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 2 | System Overview: Two-Layer Architecture
Transition & Dual-Track Principle

AEP is designed as an institutional architecture driven by verifiable public impact, and its deployment follows a migration route of “engineering first, then scaling; local first, then global.”

AEP does not require or assume that real-world societies can replace existing financial and asset systems in one shot. Instead, AEP defaults to pilots, special zones, local closed loops, and dual-track coexistence as a starting point: first establish—within a limited scope—a verifiable closed loop of task → evidence → verification → ledger, and only after long-run data proves feasibility and controllability, gradually expand coverage.

During migration, AEP’s core constraints remain unchanged:

DemandCoin can be minted only by verifiable PSA.

Existing assets and legacy contracts are not promised, by default, to be “automatically redeemed or repriced” inside the AEP protocol text.

AEP provides a staged institutional interface: it allows individuals, organizations, and regions to voluntarily enter AEP pilot modules (e.g., Ledger-only, vouchers, closed internal circulation, partial Layer 0), and gradually upgrade into deeper integration forms through engineering acceptance thresholds.

The purpose of these transition principles is to avoid uncontrolled systemic shocks caused by institutional replacement, while ensuring every scaling step has verifiable engineering basis, traceable rule versions, and rollback-capable risk handling.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.1 Layer 0: Survival Stack

Basic survival (food, basic housing, basic clothing, public transportation, basic healthcare, etc.) is defined as public-infrastructure-grade service. Any natural person, regardless of whether their DemandCoin balance is positive/zero/negative, can receive baseline survival supply without discrimination.

Survival is a right, not a reward.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.1.1 Layer 0 Upgrade Principle (Evolving Commons)

Layer 0 not only guarantees “being alive,” but also carries the responsibility to gradually raise baseline living standards as civilizational productivity improves.

Constrained by verifiable supply capacity, marginal cost, and social carrying capacity, the system will, in phases, incorporate mature, scalable, and strongly survival-linked key technologies into Layer 0 standard supply.

An upgrade is not a promise of welfare expansion, but an engineering inclusion grounded in physical deliverability:

can supply

can maintain

can audit

can roll back

Only then may it enter Layer 0.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.1.2 SEF (Survival Evolution Fund)

To support continuous upgrades of Layer 0, the system establishes the Survival Evolution Fund (SEF), strictly limited to:

Engineering modifications, infrastructure scaling, supply-chain rollout, and long-term maintenance required for Layer 0 upgrades

Public deployment (hardware/software/process/training/standards/audit system) of key general technologies that are “publicly available or publicly licensed”

Systemic risk buffering and emergency fallback plans during upgrade implementation (without affecting baseline entitlements)

SEF is not general fiscal spending. It is not used for direct Layer 1 subsidies or private consumption assistance. Its sole mission is to convert “mature and scalable” technological dividends into baseline allocation for all humanity.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.2 Layer 1: Experience Market

Above the survival stack, AEP preserves the free market to provide diversity, personalization, and scarce experiences. DemandCoin is used to exchange for higher-tier convenience, aesthetics, scarce resources, professional services, and extreme experiences.

Base version is free; advanced version is paid.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.3 Quotas & Increasing Marginal Cost (Anti-Waste)

Layer 0 uses a structure of:

identity-bound + standard quota free + threshold-triggered payment

Within reasonable thresholds: free access and use

Beyond threshold: triggers DemandCoin payment (increasing marginal cost)

Thus: survival guarantees remain unaffected, while waste becomes expensive

For high-risk or high-abuse categories in Layer 1, the system may enable the “three-piece kit” of base quota + excess deposit + progressive friction per 3.3.5.5 to suppress abuse and Sybil attacks, but must not erode Layer 0 survival rights.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4 Free Market Projects (FMP) — Transfer Only, No Minting; Public Impact Recognition Allowed

Free market projects are voluntary collaboration and commercial/innovation project forms in Layer 1. Their core mission is to provide space for personalized experience, competition, innovation, and entertainment, while serving as the primary circulation pool and resource allocation arena for DemandCoin.

The free market obeys the Minting Law: financing, trading, dividends, and business profits within the free market are all redistribution of existing DemandCoin. No minting may be triggered by valuation, capital gains, interest-on-holding, or profit.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.1 Definition & Boundary (No Minting, Only Transfer)

Transfer only, no minting. Fundraising, spending, dividends, trading, and commercial revenue are all circulation of existing DemandCoin.

No minting may be triggered by financing, holding, trading, valuation changes, capital gains, or business profit.

Project success/failure only affects credibility, collaboration capacity, and market outcomes in Layer 1; it does not automatically generate new coin.

Dual channels in parallel: Project Board and Private Contracts. Parties may choose between the public “Project Board” and peer-to-peer “Private Contracts” (see 2.4.6).
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.2 Public Impact Review & Recognition

To prevent real breakthroughs and excellent contributions from being missed—without breaking the minting boundary—the system allows free market outcomes to apply for Public Impact Review and enter the public project evaluation framework:

Any individual/collective may initiate a review request, claiming verifiable public benefit or quantifiable harm reduction.

Once accepted, the system creates a corresponding Recognition PSP under public-project standards, using the best available model and an invitation-based review to evaluate, attribute, and settle public impact.

Review/verification/recheck/dispute handling may be opened as PSA, but their contribution weights follow low weight + cap + dynamic calibration, with reasonable averaging across service participants; parameters and version switching must be versioned on-ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.3 Recognition Pricing: Count Public Impact Increment Only, Not Commercial Profit (No Double Counting)

Recognition only prices the public-impact entity itself, not commercial profit:

Recognition minting only targets: incremental public impact or incremental harm reduction that is reviewable and confirmed within baseline + noise-cancellation frameworks.

Commercial profit, market share, asset prices, valuation changes belong solely to free-market outcomes and may not be used as minting basis.

If one result has both commercial and public-impact attributes, it must be split into two paths:

commercial part: settled inside free market

public part: recognized under public-project rules

no double pricing on the same metric and same increment.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.4 Acceptance Gate: Auditability & Evidence Floor (Auditability Gate)

To avoid the arbitrage path of “black-box profit first,公益-narrative laundering later,” applications must meet minimum engineering and evidence requirements:

Process and key results must retain auditable evidence (encrypted notarization / hash notarization / sharded custody, etc.), and must be providable for review after acceptance.

Key conclusions must meet the same verification foundation as public projects: multi-source redundancy, random sampling, physical constraints, correlation and consistency checks.

If requirements are unmet, at most it can enter Ledger-only (record samples and experience only) and may not trigger recognition minting.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.5 Versioning & Accountability Anchoring (Versioned & Accountable)

Acceptance conditions, review processes, evidence thresholds, model versions, parameter calibration, settlement rules, and recognition conclusions must all be:

versioned and written into the chain ledger (traceable, auditable, roll-backable)

review actions and key signatures must enter the causal chain, bearing responsibilities and downstream repair duties under the AEP accountability structure.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.6 Project Board & Private Contracts in Parallel

Free Market Project Board: standardized tools for public posting, recruiting collaborators, and financing matching; only transfers DemandCoin; triggers no minting.

Private Contracting: parties may bypass the board and contract directly; but if risk-control rules, audit triggers, or dispute arbitration are hit, they must still comply with AEP audit trails and accountability structures.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.7 Liquidity Valves & Market Finance
2.4.7.1 Survival & Reasonable Savings Buffer

Under Root ID, AEP sets a “survival & reasonable savings buffer.” Balances within the buffer are exempt from idle-decay and friction fees.

Cap basis: anchored to a multiple of “regional annual per-capita average consumption,” typically 100–120×; specific multiple is dynamically calibrated by the model using system pressure, supply capacity, and risk data, and versioned on-ledger.

Regional boundary: regions that joined AEP are included; if new regions join before statistical release, extend collection to avoid distortion; regions joining after Lichun (true solar time) are excluded from current cycle and included next cycle.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.7.2 Idle-Decay (Primary Valve): Applies Only to Excess Idle Stock, Annual Accrual with Hard Cap

Idle-decay suppresses long-term hoarding and frozen wealth, with hard constraints:

only applies to balances above buffer

accrued annually (not daily/monthly)

decay intensity has a hard cap

Idle determination: only if excess balance lacks meaningful circulation, public-purpose lock, or other reviewable non-hoarding use in rolling window; definition versioned on-ledger.

Tiered decay: segmented by excess size; larger and longer-idle decays more; smaller excess decays less.

Hard boundary: maximum annual decay cannot exceed 20% (hard cap). Thresholds and multipliers are not fixed in text; they are model-calibrated and versioned on-ledger.

Routing: decayed-out amount does not go to counterparties; it is dynamically routed to burn, SEF, and Resilience Vault, with ratios calibrated and versioned on-ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.7.3 Heat Friction Fee (Secondary Valve): Not Paid to Counterparty

To suppress run-like shocks after long idleness (large sudden spending), the system adds a Heat Friction Fee to transactions matching combined features; fee goes to a system routing pool.

Trigger features: long idleness + excess balance + large single spend / abnormal high-frequency spend (definitions calibrated and versioned).

Exemptions/reduced load: Layer 0 upgrade procurement, remedy projects, judicial enforcement, and system security payments may be exempt or charged lower.

Anti-evasion: account splitting, circular transfers, fake locks trigger anti-cheat and credit-hash rules and may open audit windows.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.7.4 Financing Principle: Eliminate Risk-Free Lending; Use Risk-Sharing Contracts

AEP free market does not retain fixed-interest lending structures that fully shift risk to borrowers. Any capital provider must bear auditable risk exposure consistent with project outcomes. Default financing is risk-sharing contracts (investment/partnership-like).

Success trigger: profit sharing only when project success and收益 are verifiable.

Failure handling: no profit sharing; contracts specify stop-loss remedy or dissolution liquidation. Remaining physical resources can apply for public “resource recovery” projects with traceable, reviewable process.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.8 Dynamic Pricing & Anti-Hoarding for Natural/Public Resources

Natural and public resources use dynamic pricing (based on scarcity, replenishment pressure, and risk signals) plus Public Buyback Parity: the system buyback price equals the original purchase price for the same buyer—blocking “buy–hoard–resell-to-system” speculation.

Purchase quotas: individuals/companies have unconditional purchase caps; certified free-market projects, reviewed public projects, and PPIP may apply for higher quotas based on project needs (model-calibrated, versioned).

Resale to free market is allowed, but with dynamic replenishment and buyback parity, hoarding premium is structurally compressed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.9 Innovation Firewall Between Layer 0 and Free Market: Tech Safe Harbor + Public as Biggest Buyer/Partner

To prevent public-scale from “maliciously intercepting” free-market innovation, AEP uses asymmetric competition rules:

Tech Safe Harbor: during patent exclusivity, Layer 0 shall not initiate clone R&D identical to the patent’s target. Layer 0 R&D should focus on cost reduction, universality, durability, and maintenance constraints rather than direct substitution.

Public as biggest buyer/partner: if a free-market technology is assessed as necessary for Layer 0 upgrades, prioritize purchase, licensing, or cooperation rather than competitive replication.

Revenue boundary for tech used in Layer 0: within exclusivity, returns follow agreement; after exclusivity ends, tech becomes Layer 0 public upgrade and no longer yields usage-based income.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.10 Public–Private Integrated Projects (PPIP): Voluntary Cooperation, Risk Sharing, Information Isolation

Between “waiting for exclusivity to end” and “forced appropriation,” AEP allows PPIP: initiated by high-rank maintainers on behalf of public side or proposed by individuals/companies; voluntary and risk-sharing to accelerate usable Layer 0 upgrades.

Distinguish two paths:

transfer/licensing (Layer 0 purchases/uses exclusive tech)

co-development (joint R&D/testing/engineering)

Reward examples:

A) one-time lump-sum DemandCoin for transfer/licensing

B) usage-based payout: evaluate usage frequency, breadth, component share within the system, and verified benefit outcomes; pay by actual usage volume. Low frequency → higher unit reward; high frequency → lower unit reward. Parameters are model-calibrated and versioned.

Secrecy & info isolation: PPIP main agreement and core path are not public by default. To mobilize society without leaking secrets, the main project must be decomposed into many mutually non-interpretable subprojects released as public tasks under information isolation; subproject standards remain auditable.

Failure handling: risk-sharing applies; no interest-like return; stop-loss or dissolution; resource recovery can be publicized.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.11 Conflict of Interest & Recusal: Maintainers Owning Companies

Maintainers may found/hold companies, but strict recusal applies: no maintainer may, in the name of public interest, privately cooperate with companies they or other maintainers own/control.

Any cooperation involving maintainer-held companies must be converted into a public project with open recruitment: disclose research direction and possibility range, disclose risk-control labels and signature chain; accept multi-domain signatures, random audits, and circuit breakers.

Prohibit “high-level council rule” and cartel clustering: key decisions must not be sealed by a small fixed group. Triggers, sampling intensity, and fuse thresholds are model-calibrated and versioned on-ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
2.4.12 Merit-Based Onramp: Free-Market Actors Becoming High-Rank Maintainers

Individuals/companies in free market may apply to enter maintainer system based on professional ability and verified public contribution. High-rank status must be locked to verifiable contribution: only sustained, significant, auditable contributions qualify. Admission thresholds and review standards are model-calibrated and versioned on-ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 3 | DemandCoin: Definition & Principles
3.1 Minting Law

DemandCoin is the public-value credential in AEP. Its minting follows an immovable law:

DemandCoin can only be minted through verifiable PSA in public service projects.

The following do not mint new coins:

private transactions

speculation/arbitrage

asset holding

capital gains

This ensures money supply is always anchored to real, perceivable public value creation.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.2 Chain Ledger & Irreversible Civilizational Memory

Each minted unit of DemandCoin (fractional allowed) generates an independent chain record at birth.

Records include: corresponding service act, the PSP it belongs to, evaluation parameters, timestamp, subsequent impact/harm and repair linkages.

Even if a coin is spent, burned, or causally reclaimed, the coin exits circulation but the associated service record and impact/harm history remain permanently, for learning, causal tracing, and civilizational memory.

Transfer-as-Ledger: DemandCoin is fully electronic settlement. Any balance-change event—transfer, payment, tax, burn, reclaim, freeze/unfreeze, rollback, correction—must generate an immutable ledger record and link bidirectionally to PSA/project/attribution pointers. Any movement without on-ledger record is invalid settlement.

Money can be consumed; contribution must not be erased. Coins may vanish, but civilization must not lose memory.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.2.1 Implementation Prerequisites: Protocol Layer vs Engineering Layer

AEP has two layers: protocol and engineering. Protocol defines public-affairs boundary, PSA standards, impact attribution, accountability structure, incentives; engineering provides verifiability, non-repudiation, and low-cost auditing.

A self-consistent protocol ≠ a runnable system.
Without reliable data capture, identity binding, evidence notarization, random audits, and causal tracing, minting and repair cannot function; clauses remain on paper.

Feasibility depends on engineering realization of “verifiable public impact.”
Engineering should prioritize: multi-source data collection, baseline/control models, anomaly detection, random sampling, penetrating recheck processes.

Images are easier to fake; data can be attacked.
AEP does not assume data is “naturally trustworthy.” It assumes forgery cost can be raised: multi-source redundancy + random sampling + physical constraints + correlation checks make long-term systemic cheating unsustainable.

Migration priority: engineering first, then scaling.
Start with small pilots in measurable, auditable public domains; expand PSA coverage only after stable audit loops.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.2.2 Privacy-Preserving Verification: Against Panopticon Fear

AEP aims at verifiable public impact, not publicizing private life. Data use follows purpose limitation and minimal disclosure: only what is necessary for verifying PSA validity, tracking impact/harm, and completing causal tracing.

(a) Dual-Repository Structure: Public Result Ledger vs Root Sealed Vault

Public Result Ledger (public): records only verifiable verdicts and necessary summaries: act/project IDs, verification result (valid/invalid/pending audit), settlement summary, rule version, audit event ID, verifiable proofs (e.g., certificate hash).

Root Sealed Vault (not public): stores evidence-pack hash indexes, source signatures, detailed parameters, encrypted pointers to raw data, bound permanently to Root ID for rechecks, dispute handling, and liability handoff.

(b) Publish Verdict, Not Raw Data

By default, publish verification verdicts and proofs, not raw private data, detailed processes, personal trajectories, or sensitive parameters.

(c) Reveal / Piercing with Due Process

Only under anomaly reports, high-risk signals, or case investigations may sealed vault access be pierced, with constraints:

clear cause: reason/scope/period/fields specified

notice & cooperation window in principle (except urgent harm)

minimal necessary access

full trace and accountability: every piercing action is logged with operator, scope, permission, outputs; abuse triggers liability and circuit breaker
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3 PSA Verification & Anti-Fraud

AEP’s minting premise: no output, no coin.

To prevent task grinding, false reporting, and collusion, AEP adopts a three-layer verification structure and includes acceptors into the causal chain.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.0 AI Execution Premise for Verification, Attribution, Anti-Fraud

Whether a PSA is valid, what attribution weights are, and therefore minting/reclaim/streaming/liability allocation—all are computed and decided by system AI using the best available model at that time, and that output is the sole calculation basis for settlement.

To make long-term systemic cheating unsustainable, AEP uses engineering constraints:

multi-source redundancy

random sampling & surprise audits

physical constraints (time/space fences, device signatures, process-order constraints, conservation checks)

correlation & consistency checks across sources and behavior graphs

Human maintainers/reviewers set boundaries and handle disputes and irreversible responsibilities; they do not manually compute case-by-case attribution weights to avoid infinite detail wars. Model iteration and parameter updates are allowed and must be versioned on-ledger for learning.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.1 Layer 1: Physical Causal Closure

Minting requires a verifiable completion report: the system must confirm via objective data that the act caused the output or measurable harm reduction.

causal anchoring: if metrics fail thresholds or causality cannot be established, PSA is invalid; no minting.

multi-source audits: use sensors, device logs, remote sensing, energy/flow logs, runtime, etc. Examples: tree planting must show vegetation growth via remote sensing/random checks; pipeline maintenance must show improvements in leakage rate, downtime, energy use, etc.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.2 Layer 2: Peer Audit with Liability

Acceptance/review is not decided by single authority. Qualified reviewers participate; their signatures enter the causal chain (“signing implies joint liability”):

reviewers bear liability proportional to influence if later fraud/risk omission causes harm.

self-protective incentives raise audit strictness.

cross-validation for high-risk/high-value: random third-party professional reviewers; blind processes when needed.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.3 Layer 3: Credit Hash Circuit Breaker & Permission Downgrade

AEP is not punishment-centric, but cheating must become unbearably costly:

credit hash: built from real PSA; affects task matching weights, permission levels, task scope.

circuit breaker: confirmed collusion/false reporting triggers irreversible downgrade:

Layer 0 survival remains

but high-risk public tasks, scarce access, key certifications become restricted for a period or scope

public trace: cheating-related PSA and review chain stay on-ledger permanently.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.4 Anti-Grinding & Anti-Collusion: Engineering Preconditions & Systemic Constraints
Implementation Prerequisite (Hard Constraint)

AEP’s feasibility does not depend on whether the text “sounds good,” but on whether verification and auditing can be engineered. Video evidence is relatively easier to forge; data can also be attacked. The system must raise the cost of cheating through:

multi-source redundancy

random sampling

physical constraints

correlation & consistency checks

so that “long-term systemic cheating” becomes unsustainable.

If the minimum engineering standard in this section cannot be met, that project category must not be eligible for minting, and may only run in Ledger-Only (record/training mode).
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.4.1 Hard Schema: Mandatory Fields in Task Templates

Any mint-eligible public project (Project) and subtask (Task) must hard-code the following fields in its template—none may be omitted. Any field change must be versioned and traceable:

Metric Set: at least 1 primary metric + supporting metrics (e.g., output, energy, downtime, incident rate, leakage rate), with sampling frequency and calculation standard.

Baseline Spec: define natural baseline B₀ and operational baseline B₁ (if applicable), plus control/noise-cancellation method and confidence threshold.

Evidence Checklist: define must-have vs optional evidence, with sources and generation methods.

Geo/Time Fence: valid execution region, time window, allowable offsets, and out-of-bound handling.

Acceptance Threshold: minimum effective change threshold, statistical significance gate, and invalid conditions (e.g., no threshold crossing / no causal closure).

Audit Policy: random sampling ratio, deep-audit triggers, and audit-window settlement rules (freeze / delay / rollback).

Liability Anchors: rules for acceptor/reviewer signatures entering causal chain, influence weight, and liability triggers.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.4.2 Evidence Hierarchy: Multi-Source Redundancy with Anti-Forgery Priority

The system sets evidence reliability priority and requires at least “multi-source consistency”:

Tier-1 Evidence (preferred): device/sensor streams, energy/flow/runtime logs, industrial control logs, irreversible metering records (prefer hardware signatures and tamper-resistant logs).

Tier-2 Evidence (auxiliary): video/live stream/aerial/remote sensing comparison, manual records, witness statements.

Cross-Validation Rule: a single source is insufficient to trigger minting. At least ≥2 independent sources must consistently point to the same metric change. Video may only serve as existence/process support and must not be the sole basis for “impact validity.”

How to confirm two sources are “independent”?

Different source types: include at least 1 Tier-1 source (remote sensing/sensors/tamper-proof logs/random checks)

Different signatures: evidence packs must carry source signatures; keys/device fingerprints must not belong to the same control domain

Different pipelines: one from executor reporting, another from system random audit / third-party remote-sensing interface

Different times: span at least one growth window (e.g., 30/60/90 days) to avoid same-day fabrication
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.4.3 Relational Consistency Checks

The system must check consistency across act → metrics → resources; any inconsistency is high risk:

Input–output consistency: declared inputs (labor/material/equipment use) must match output change magnitude.

Multi-metric linkage: e.g., “leak repair” should align with leakage decrease plus compatible changes in flow/energy/downtime; single-metric improvement without explanation defaults to audit.

Cross-task / cross-project consistency: same actor showing abnormal similarity in evidence fingerprints, device fingerprints, and trajectory patterns triggers collusion-risk tags.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.4.4 Anti-Grinding: Decay Curve + Spatiotemporal Consistency + Longevity Bonus

To suppress “short-time high-frequency grinding” while not punishing real long-term contributors, AEP applies a strict order: validity first, then frequency, and adds a four-piece kit:

task-family standard

spatiotemporal consistency checks

decay curve

longevity bonus for long-term net impact

Hard Rule (Validity First)

Anti-grinding applies only to already-valid PSAs. If a service act fails acceptance thresholds, lacks causal closure, or fails minimum evidence consistency, it is an invalid PSA (0 mint) and does not enter frequency-decay/compensation calculations.

Model-Calibrated & Versioned-on-Ledger Parameters

All clustering rules, frequency windows, decay curve shape/params, spatiotemporal thresholds, sampling weights, compensation standards, etc., are dynamically calibrated by AI using the best available model. Any change must be versioned on-ledger with at least:

effective time

scope

reason summary

backtest/evaluation summary

risk impact note and rollback conditions

Settlement uses the version effective at the time of PSA; no retroactive parameter arbitrage.

(0) Task Family Definition: One Standard to Block Loopholes

The system clusters “similar tasks” by Task Family Fingerprint; frequency stats, anomaly detection, sampling triggers, and decay all run per task family, defined by:

tags (domain/subdomain/risk tier/resource type)

physical fence (geo-fence + facility/plot/line IDs)

process type (inspection/weeding/fertilizing/welding/reinforcement/transport/delivery, etc.)

evidence template hash (same must-have evidence structure)

This definition must be versioned. Any change is a rule upgrade, with reason and scope; may specify transitional application to unsettled PSAs; may not be used to retroactively arbitrage settled history.

(A) Burst Decay Curve (Not a Threshold)

For the typical pattern—abnormally high frequency in a short window—the system applies diminishing marginal reward weights to same actor + same task family valid PSAs:

inputs: frequency of valid PSAs per unit time, task difficulty coefficient, evidence quality score, net-impact contribution (per attribution model)

output: continuous decay of instant reward weight (a curve), not a hard cutoff

intuition: denser frequency closer to mechanical grinding → faster marginal decay; reasonable frequency + strong impact → little or no decay

anti-gaming: curve uses smoothing and hysteresis to prevent “window sniping,” and is dynamically calibrated by task supply/demand and fraud risk

This decay only affects marginal reward on the frequency dimension; it does not change PSA validity and does not replace acceptance thresholds/causal closure.

(B) Spatial Distance & Travel Time: Near-Range vs Far-Range

The system must include spatial distance / reachability:

Case 1: Near-range
Compute “reasonable travel-time window” from local transportation network and conditions; check:

whether frequency is reachable within that window (trajectory/check-in/device signatures consistent)

whether abnormal dense shuttle patterns exist without corresponding resource use and metric linkage

If reachable and validity is strong, handle mainly via (A) decay curve; if unreachable or evidence chain breaks, enter deep audit.

Case 2: Far-range
For far-distance high-frequency “valid PSAs,” default suspicion is ID hijacking/paid grinding; first audit identity/device consistency:

device signature/key continuity, terminal fingerprint and trajectory continuity

evidence generation device vs execution device consistency

temporal continuity (impossible time jumps)

Only after passing identity + spatiotemporal checks does it enter (A) decay; otherwise treat as fraud.

Note: spatial checks do not mean publicizing personal trajectories; verification can be privacy-preserving (hashes + verifiable verdicts).

(C) Longevity Bonus: Reward Long-Term Net Impact, Not Count

To prevent “the longer you work, the less each act is worth,” the system compensates long-term stable contributions—but the compensation targets net impact and stability, not count:

trigger: multiple consecutive cycles passing sampling and consistency checks, with stable linkage to long-term metric improvement

measurement: weighted by net impact / harm reduction in stability window, not by PSA count

compatibility with 5.3: must align with baseline drift/reset; after operational baseline B₁ refresh, compensation only applies to increments above new baseline; no double counting
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.4.5 Anti-Collusion: Group Graph + Random Sampling + Deep Audit

The system continuously builds reviewer/acceptor/peer-audit relationship graphs and applies engineering constraints to structural collusion:

mutual-audit density threshold: if a small group’s mutual acceptance/recommendation density crosses a threshold, sampling and audit intensity auto-increase

deep random audit: cross-domain third-party professional rechecks, possibly requiring additional Tier-1 evidence

suspicious rewards handling: within audit window, disputed PSA rewards may be delayed or partially frozen; after conclusion, release/reclaim/liability allocation is executed
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.4.6 Data Attacks & Tampering Risk: Minimum Security Bar

Key data sources must meet minimum security; otherwise the task category cannot mint:

hardware/device signatures + key rotation

multi-source reconciliation (at least two different physical measurement mechanisms, e.g., energy meter + device logs)

tamper-resistant audit logs for evidence pack and verification verdict

anomaly detection + rollback capability (rollback/reverify/isolate liability after data source contamination/model attack)
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.5 Sub-accounts, Privacy & Piercing (Compliance Through Penetration)
3.3.5.1 Root ID & Sub-account: General Rules

One Root ID per natural person: ultimate liability attribution, credit aggregation, permission tiering. Root ID is not public by default.

Sub-account as default trading identity: the outward-facing identity in Layer 1; sub-accounts can be rotated/created/disabled but are not new identities.

Aggregation and no-escape liability: reputation, violations, profit structure, and risk tags of sub-accounts aggregate back to Root ID; the system retains verifiable internal mapping for auditing and liability.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.5.2 Non-transferable & Non-shareable

no transfer: sub-accounts cannot be sold/gifted/rented/custodied for others

no sharing: sub-accounts cannot be used by multiple people; joint payment must use system-defined “joint payment agreement,” with accountable payer and beneficiary

anti-borrowing binding: device signatures/terminal fingerprints/behavior consistency checks; suspected borrowing/proxy/grinding enters high-risk audit window
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.5.3 Piercing: Triggers, Traceability, Liability

piercing requires triggers: only under protocol-defined audit/judicial/major-risk conditions may a sub-account map to Root ID

piercing must be fully logged: initiator, trigger basis, permission level, query scope, timestamp, approval chain, result summary, actions

abuse is major harm: unjustified/over-scoped/over-permission/bad-faith piercing is major public harm to privacy and safety; enters restorative process and triggers circuit breaker + liability recovery
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.5.4 Opt-in Root Disclosure & Anti-coercion

user may choose to disclose Root: only via explicit informed consent with strong verification; can revoke anytime; after revocation, outward identity returns to sub-account (internal piercing still possible for liability)

no coercion to default-public Root: maintainers, public project operators, reviewers/auditors, and Layer 1 market providers may not induce/require Root disclosure in the name of compliance/safety/efficiency/convenience

no bundling or discrimination: Root-public cannot be a condition for Layer 0 supply, public services, basic rights, or necessary public interfaces; violations must be on-ledger accountable
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
3.3.5.5 “Quota + Risk Deposit + Progressive Friction” (Anti-Sybil & Anti-Abuse)

Base quota: for high-abuse/high-risk categories (e.g., ultra-high-frequency trading, excess volume, scarce rush-buy), set periodic base quotas per Root ID

Excess deposit: exceeding quota requires a risk deposit and observation period; after observation, deposit is returned/frozen/disposed per risk conclusion; may trigger piercing/audit. Deposit is guarantee, not “buying entitlement.”

Progressive friction: exceeding may trigger progressive friction costs (wait/cooldown/fees/queue costs) to suppress abuse and prevent “buying quota with money.” Must not erode Layer 0 survival rights.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 4 | Public Service Project System
4.1 Definition of Public Affairs

Public affairs are actions/projects that meet:

create positive or restorative value for society as a whole

are not suitable for private monopoly

have impacts/harms that can be assessed, tracked, or repaired

Including but not limited to:

agriculture & ecological restoration

healthcare & public health

science & breakthroughs

infrastructure construction & operations

education & culture

governance & public order

civic mental health / social mind education and other stability domains
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
4.2 Sub-project Decomposition

Any large public project must be decomposed into as many subtasks as possible to:

lower participation threshold

expand participation breadth

increase collaboration and unity

let more people earn DemandCoin via real actions

Example: forest restoration can be decomposed into planting, maintenance, patrol, monitoring, data analysis, education outreach, etc.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 5 | Minting & Rewards: Dynamic Adjustment Mechanisms
5.1 Reward Shaping

The system monitors supply/demand and participation in real time and adjusts DemandCoin rewards:

too many participants → reward decreases

long-term labor shortage → reward increases

Example: too many harvesters → pay down; urgent tree planting → pay up.

This also applies to maintainer participation in public projects.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.1.1 Implementation Preconditions: Validity First & Unified Risk-Control Standard

All reward shaping and anti-fraud follow one premise: PSA validity first. Any act that fails acceptance conditions, produces no verifiable metric improvement/harm reduction, is not a PSA; minting result is 0.

Given PSA is valid:

anti-grinding and anti-hijack apply 3.3.4.4 task-family + decay curve + spatiotemporal consistency + longevity bonus

trading privacy/sub-account/piercing and “quota+deposit+progressive friction” apply 3.3.5

Human maintainers/review primarily set boundaries, arbitrate disputes, and manage high-risk liability; PSA validity and attribution weights are computed by AI with best available model, and conclusions are on-ledger traceable.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.1.2 Anti-Oscillation & Dual-Track Model Upgrade

To avoid frequent reward swings causing window-sniping, supply-demand oscillation, the system enforces stable switching:

Smoothing & hysteresis: reward weights, thresholds, and eligibility changes must be smoothed; short-cycle adjustment amplitude is limited.

Minimum stability window: key reward parameters must have minimum effective window; no repeated flips unless high-risk anomaly triggers emergency fuse.

Emergency circuit breaker: on window-sniping, collusion, abnormal congestion, supply collapse risk, or abnormal pricing/queue pressure, allow temporary fuse: new settlements for that task family enter audit/freeze window; temporary conservative parameters apply. All must be versioned on-ledger.

Dual-track upgrades: for major model upgrades, default enters dual-track:

Shadow track: new model produces shadow settlement only for evaluation; no minting/streaming.

Main track: old model remains sole effective settlement until dual-track passes.

Cutover & Payout Transition

After dual-track passes, system sets a clear cutover epoch/block on-ledger and switches to a single effective track:

only one effective settlement track at any time

no retroactive re-mint: finalized payouts before cutover are not recalculated

forward-only on unfinalized items: new model applies after cutover; pre-cutover but unresolved PSAs in audit/freeze may be finalized under new model

streaming migration: for ongoing long-term projects, already-paid periods stay; future unpaid periods use new model; apply smoothing/limits to prevent cliffs; parameters versioned

fraud/data contamination exception: if audit confirms fraud or source pollution, rollback/reclaim rules apply (not “retroactive model arbitrage”)

All smoothing, stability windows, fuse events, dual-track periods, cutover decisions must be versioned on-ledger (traceable/auditable/rollbackable).
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.1.3 Dispute Exit Valves: Appeal, Review & Consensus Rebase

To prevent long-term divergence between algorithmic settlement and human common sense—while avoiding infinite appeals—AEP uses tiered dispute routing. It does not chase “final truth,” only “reviewable, traceable, calibratable.”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.1.3.1 Three-Lane Routing

Disputes are classified:

Validity dispute: whether PSA is valid (evidence floor, causal closure)

Attribution dispute: whether contribution weights have significant bias

Structural dispute: templates/rules/models systematically diverge from common sense

Structural disputes cannot flood validity/attribution lanes; system auto-detects and routes (5.1.3.4).
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.1.3.2 Two-Stage Handling (Fast Review → Piercing Review)

Stage 1: Fast review
Recompute with same version model but higher audit intensity; call more sources, strengthen consistency checks, increase anomaly sensitivity. Output only decides whether to enter stage 2; it does not change the version.

Stage 2: Piercing review (only if one holds)

fast review still shows significant bias; or

high-risk signals triggered (collusion, hijack, abnormal fingerprints, physical conflicts); or

involves Layer 0 / public safety high externality

Piercing review by maintainer audit pool:

random selection + cross-domain recusal for conflicts

audit actions enter causal chain with liability

verdict must cite evidence sufficiency, rule version, reviewable reasons, boundaries
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.1.3.3 Burden, Deadlines & Anti-Spam

burden of proof: appellant submits supplementary evidence; maintainers must provide missing-item checklist and cited standards, but need not “find evidence for you”

submission deadline: one-time supplement window; late → close as-is

time-bounded audits: max handling time; overrun must publish reasons and version record

anti-abuse: repetitive/no-new-evidence/malicious appeals may face higher gates (deposit/queue weight/frequency limits) without affecting Layer 0
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.1.3.4 Cluster Trigger & Rebase Lane for Structural Disputes

If dispute density for a task family/template version spikes above historical baseline:

later similar disputes are routed into structural calibration as primary lane

calibration by long-term domain service actors + maintainers

outputs template/rule/model adjustment proposals

executed via dual-track upgrade (5.1.2)
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.1.3.5 No Retroactive Arbitrage & Reward Boundaries

Rule revisions/model governance are maintainer-governance PSA:

no retroactive payout claims

no long-tail binding to affected task families

reward only for governance act itself within its impact window
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.1.3.6 Versioned-on-Ledger

Dispute handling must be fully versioned on-ledger: dispute type, cited rule version, review intensity config, auditor selection/recusal, verdict text, deadlines/anomalies, and any triggered template/model switch decisions.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.2 Impact Streaming (Default-On)

For all long-term public impact projects, the system enables streaming by default:

immediate delivery: after valid PSA, mint a one-time base reward (may cap per project)

streaming: within the project’s impact period, the system periodically streams DemandCoin to historical contributors; stops when period ends

cyclical long-term projects: each cycle starts streaming; ends stops; next cycle restarts
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.3 Baseline Drift & Rebase

To prevent “perpetual motion merit” (one improvement → endless mint), long-term projects use dual baselines and rebase rules for sustainable incentives.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.3.1 Dual Baselines

Natural baseline B₀ (counterfactual): in the hypothetical world with no new intervention/PSA, expected output/impact under natural evolution and depreciation trends.

Operational baseline B₁ (realistic running baseline): current stable output/impact under minimum maintenance in the real world.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.3.2 Rebase Trigger Conditions

Rebase B₁ only if all hold:

stability window: N natural cycles (suggest 3 annual/seasonal cycles) stable around new platform with narrow band (e.g., ±3%)

intervention-off test: within stability window, incremental PSA inputs directly tied to uplift have decayed to minimum maintenance; if continued new input exists, uplift remains “project impact stream,” not baseline

noise cancellation: remove climate/price/variety diffusion/policy variables via control/regression/matching; confirm causal linkage to specific PSA chain

Then rebase B₁ to new value.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.3.3 Sunset Tail after Rebase

Rebase does not instantly zero out past contributors. Use Sunset Tail:

after B₁ rebase, prior contributors receive decaying tail payments for T cycles (suggest 5–10 years), decaying to 0

tail corresponds only to the platform shift locked into baseline; cannot double count with later projects
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.3.4 Only Pay Above the New Baseline

After B₁ is rebased:

only increments above new B₁ receive instant rewards and streaming

attempts to restate the same platform improvement to re-mint are invalid PSA
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
5.3.5 Anti Double Counting

Sunset tail must not double count with maintenance impact streams or other streams on the same metric increment. Every public impact can have only one clear causal attribution path and one pricing event in the ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 6 | System Maintainers
6.1 Role Definition

System Maintainers correspond to the “public stability functions” of governments and public institutions in the old world—but their power source, incentives, and accountability structure are redefined in AEP.

Maintainers do not enjoy fixed privileges detached from the DemandCoin system. Their work is issued, verified, settled, and ledgered as Public Service Projects, and they bear traceable responsibility for the boundaries, processes, and consequences of critical public modules.

Their core duties include (non-exhaustive):

Identity & permissions: generation, authentication, maintenance of Root ID and permission tiering

Justice & procedure: adjudication, dispute mediation, procedural execution, dispute resolution

Research & recognition: review/recognition of patents and scientific contributions and attribution shares

Infrastructure operations: long-run continuity of infrastructure and key public systems

Public credit & certification: public trust guarantees, skill assessment, credential verification

Public safety & order: policing and risk response

Public service operations: education, healthcare, and other stability services

Social mind & mental health: mental health and civic psychological education as stability work

Rule guidance & support: interpretation, onboarding, and system-usage support
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
6.2 Human Maintainers

Maintainer roles are held by humans. Their income and constraints align with all other participants:

No fixed privilege: no待遇/immune status outside DemandCoin

Same-track minting: they obtain DemandCoin only by completing verifiable PSAs in public projects

Responsibility carrying: as the accountable bridge between AI and public affairs, they assume traceable responsibility for boundaries, risk control, and irreversible consequences
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
6.3 Guardian Constraints

Maintainers manage boundaries, templates, baselines, and high-risk matters. To prevent “definition power” from becoming privilege, AEP hard-anchors high-permission operations into an auditable ledger loop:

Multi-domain signatures: critical “definition power” operations require signatures across distinct duty domains and interest domains—e.g., public-affairs boundary changes, task template mandatory-field changes, acceptance-threshold adjustments, baseline setting/rebasing, major project launch/cancel, model cutovers, emergency circuit breakers

Full traceability: every high-permission action must produce non-repudiable logs: actor, permission source, request reason, scope, parameters/versions, timestamp, rollback plan, outcome summary; written into tamper-resistant audit logs linked to the chain ledger

Random audit on governors: continuous weighted random audits over maintainer/reviewer high-permission actions; may trigger recheck, delayed effect, parameter rollback, or permission downgrade

Circuit breaker: on abuse, collusion, systemic bias, or procedural defect risk, decisions/parameters/version switches enter freeze/dual-track/audit windows; conservative params or rollback to last stable version apply; triggers/scope/duration/exit conditions must be versioned on-ledger

Model-calibrated & versioned-on-ledger: signature thresholds, sampling intensity, breaker thresholds, and response strategies are dynamically calibrated by models—but every calibration and version decision must be versioned on-ledger for traceability/auditability/rollback
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
6.4 AI as Executor

AI in AEP is an execution and computation tool—not the sovereign decision-maker.

AI may independently initiate projects in high-frequency, repetitive, standardized domains with low value-conflict and strong linkage to food/clothing/shelter/transport/health (e.g., medical triage, traffic dispatch, infrastructure maintenance, skill certification workflows).

For complex, strategic, or irreversible projects, human maintainers and the review system must participate.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
6.5 Service Ranks & Anti-Idle

To prevent “seniority idling,” AEP creates an upgradable/downgradable maintainer rank system under Root ID. Ranks reflect long-term effective service capacity and do not constitute privileges outside DemandCoin.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
6.5.1 Example Rank Labels (iterable)

Apprentice Maintainer: completes baseline training and minimum service window; eligible for low-risk practice under increased sampling/recheck

Orderkeeper Maintainer: consistently passes sampling and rechecks; can independently handle routine maintenance, verification, audits, arbitration; accountable for conclusions

Keystone Maintainer: long-term low-error performance in key domains (justice/medical/supply/safety/certification/audit), capable of cross-domain coordination and emergency response

Civilization Guardian: long-term high-quality service plus verifiable contributions to rule optimization, risk control, and public trust; rule-optimization contributions are counted with low weight + cap + dynamic calibration + versioning (see 6.5.4)
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
6.5.2 Promotion & Retention

Promotion depends on effective service duration, pass rate, recheck consistency, dispute rate, and correction contributions; automatic time-based promotion is prohibited.

Retention requires minimum rolling-window service and continuing education/recertification. Long inactivity or quality drop can trigger demotion.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
6.5.3 Reward Structure

Maintainer rewards follow: daily settlement + rank coefficient + long-on-duty bonus.

Base settlement: maintainer PSAs settle first in Layer 0 and system-safety tasks (justice/medical/supply/transport/safety/certification/audit)

Rank coefficient: same task base reward may increase by rank coefficient with caps, tied to risk and shortage level

Long-on-duty bonus: for continuous stable on-duty service passing sampling; with caps and tapering to prevent permanent entitlements
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
6.5.4 Reward Boundaries for Rule Revision & Auditing (No Retroactive Arbitrage)

Rule revision, template calibration, and model review can be opened as public projects, but they are maintenance-type PSAs using low weight + cap + dynamic calibration + versioning.

Hard boundaries:

participants cannot claim retroactive extra payouts from the settlement standard they changed

rewards cannot be long-tail-bound to the task families covered by the revised rule
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
6.5.5 Versioning

Rank thresholds, coefficients, caps, tapering, and recertification requirements are dynamically calibrated and must be versioned into the chain ledger (traceable/auditable/rollbackable).
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 7 | Value Creation, Maintenance, and Reward Boundaries (Hard Separation)
7.1 Hard Separation of Reward Boundaries

AEP hard-separates long-term reward rights between:

Value-source projects (production/creation): contributors share the project’s long-term impact stream by contribution ratio

Maintenance/operations projects: contributors receive only the rewards for their maintenance acts; they do not share value-source projects’ long-term streams

Maintenance keeps the system running but is not automatically a value source—therefore it does not grant default “dividend rights.”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
7.2 Maintenance Impact Streaming (Independent Attribution Clause)

If maintenance acts themselves produce measurable new public benefit (e.g., stability improvement leading to fewer accidents, less downtime, reduced public harm), that benefit may be separately recognized as a Maintenance Impact Stream with independent attribution and streaming.

Constraints:

Separate accounting: only the increment attributable to maintenance (new benefit / harm reduction) is counted; it cannot be mixed into production impact streams

Quantification gate: must be verifiable and reviewable (baseline comparison, statistical significance, noise removal, etc.)

Causal closure: causal chain is separately recorded; rewards are distributed only within that maintenance stream

Periodic streaming: follows impact streaming rules; stops when its impact period ends

Purpose: allow maintenance innovation and high-level operations to earn long-term rewards while keeping boundaries clean so production streams aren’t naturally captured by ops roles.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 8 | Harm Handling & Restorative Justice
8.1 Core Principles

AEP does not implement punitive systems; it implements causal repair.

When harm occurs:

assess harm

trace causal chain

determine responsibility ratios

launch remedial public projects
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.2 Service Debt: Negative DemandCoin

If public service causes harm, the system reclaims DemandCoin proportional to damage; balances may go negative.

In negative state:

Layer 0 survival supply remains unaffected

remedial tasks are prioritized in the task list

access to unrelated high-risk/high-permission tasks may be restricted
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.3 Collective Error: Structural Causal Allocation

If harm is caused by collaborative actions, responsibility is allocated along the action chain by influence weights—no single scapegoat.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.4 Education as Repair

Education, counseling, and civic mind training are not punishments; they are necessary repairs to restore public participation capacity.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.5 Dynamic Funding Sources for Remedies

Remedial project funding sources are dynamically adjusted:

direct deduction from responsible parties

Civilization Insurance Vault

emergency minting (during deflation)

All remedial actions generate new chain records and merge with the original causal history.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.6 Layer 1 Externality Liability (Minimal Intervention, Piercing When Needed)

To balance Layer 1 freedom with public safety, AEP introduces “externality on-ledger” rules: normal market trading stays private and minimally interfered with, but any verifiable public harm must enter causal tracing and repair.

Minimal interference: no per-transaction public review in normal times; only when risk triggers are met does the system enter audit/piercing/liability allocation

Harm trigger: when key public metric domains (environment/health/safety/infrastructure stability/public order, etc.) show significant negative change meeting causal-trace thresholds, the system creates a Harm Event and writes it to the chain ledger

Causal piercing & liable set: liability is not limited to buyer/seller; any materially influential actor enters the causal chain—producer/seller/service provider/platforms/critical intermediaries/certifiers/maintainers (if applicable). Liability is allocated by attribution weights; models/thresholds/evidence standards are dynamically calibrated and versioned

Restoration first: once triggered, the system must launch remedial PSPs first; funding order: liable deductions → risk deposits (if applicable) → vault buffer/advance → emergency mechanisms if necessary; all processes/results are on-ledger

Access consequences: repeated harm triggers, refusal to remediate, or evasion can cause permission downgrades (limit access to high-risk categories, raise deposits, restrict high-risk public tasks) without affecting Layer 0
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.7 Risk Tiering + Strict Liability Backstop

To avoid extremes (“total surveillance” vs “total laissez-faire”), AEP risk-tiers Layer 1 categories/behaviors: low risk stays freer; high risk gets stronger ex-ante constraints; extreme risk uses strict-liability backstop to stop bleeding fast.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.7.1 Risk Tiers (T0–T3)

T0 (low risk): no extra constraints by default; minimal traceability for judicial/audit piercing

T1 (medium risk): lightweight controls: anomaly graph monitoring; sampling or delayed settlement window when needed

T2 (high risk): ex-ante constraints: deposits/compliance gates/qualification + higher sampling; observation period covering typical harm-lag window

T3 (extreme risk): strict liability backstop (8.7.2); may impose quotas, mandatory third-party verification, or only controlled-scene trading

Tier criteria include (non-exhaustive): historical harm rate, harm-scale upper bound, irreversibility, lag, abuse potential, coupling to public critical metrics.

All tiers/thresholds/parameters are dynamically calibrated and versioned on-ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.7.2 Strict Liability Backstop

For T3, AEP uses “restore first, attribute later”:

First restore: once harm event triggers or high-confidence warning threshold is met, system can immediately launch remedies and temporary restrictions (freeze disputed gains, restrict further trading, activate emergency substitute supply), without waiting for full attribution

Provisional liability hold: for highly related actors (candidate liable set from risk model), system may provisionally hold funds or prioritize deposits to start remedy; later attribution leads to return/add/transfer

After-the-fact attribution: full attribution within audit window: allocation, reclaim, credit/permission consequences, and systemic revisions all on-ledger
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.7.3 Platform Symmetry Rule (Profit–Liability Symmetry)

To prevent “platform earns fees while society eats harm”:

if a platform/intermediary continuously profits in a high-risk category and harm-event rate exceeds threshold:

platform automatically faces higher sampling + higher deposit requirements

platform’s default liability weight in the causal chain increases until risk falls due to improved verification/control

platform risk-control work can be opened as public projects (“risk control as service”), but cannot be used to evade existing liability
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
8.7.4 Anti-oscillation & Policy Stability

To prevent frequent tier/constraint jumps causing panic or window arbitrage, AEP introduces smoothing, hysteresis, minimum effective periods, and rollback. Each update must record: rule version, trigger basis, scope, rollback conditions—written to the chain ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 9 | Review & Balancing (Four Causal Cases)
9.1 Invitation Review & Best-Model Assist

Major, irreversible, cross-cycle, or high-risk public projects default to invitation-based review. The purpose is not mass voting; it is to impose professional constraints and responsibility into the causal chain so decisions are traceable, reviewable, and rollbackable.

Invitation & reviewer pool

the system generates candidates from a qualified reviewer pool and invites them one-by-one; candidates may accept or decline

candidate pool generation and ordering are assisted by AI using best available models, considering domain match, historical review quality, credit hash, conflict risk, mutual-review cluster density, geographic/organizational correlation, etc.

the system maintains reviewer diversity (cross-institution / cross-region / cross-network clusters), and may use double-blind/anonymous flows when needed

Conflict check & recusal

the system runs relational consistency checks between reviewers and project initiators/executors/supply chain and mutual-review ties; high-confidence conflicts are automatically recused

relationships, recusal reasons, and replacement logic must be versioned on-ledger

Review as PSA with low weight

review acts may be recorded as PSAs and earn rewards/streaming, but use low weight + cap + dynamic calibration + versioning to prevent review rewards from crowding out execution rewards

review rewards/liability are not counted by “votes,” but by influence weights on launch decisions, scheme selection, risk recognition, and key constraints—entering the causal chain

Best-model assist & dual-track safety

AI provides consistent-standards analysis for impact prediction, risk assessment, attribution, and reward estimation (including control/noise-cancellation and uncertainty bounds) to support reviewer questioning

final settlement still follows verification/attribution rules; if review-related models upgrade, the dual-track mechanism applies to avoid settlement shocks and systemic harm

Full trace & versioning

Invitations, accept/decline, recusal, replacements, review opinion highlights, key constraints, and the assisting model version/parameter summaries must be written to the chain ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
9.2 Rewards & Liability (Section Overview Only)

This section defines how AEP settles benefits and responsibilities for major reviewed projects across the four causal cases, under one unified spirit: no moral theatrics, no identity-based blame, no untouchable authority—only verifiable outcomes, causal attribution, and executable repair.

Core principles:

Outcome-gated settlement (Validity before money):
No reward is finalized unless the project’s claimed impact crosses acceptance thresholds, survives baseline comparison, and clears noise-cancellation confidence gates. If not, it is ledgered (as learning data) without minting, or placed into an audit window.

Causal-chain allocation (Credit and debt follow influence weights):
Rewards (and reclaim/service debt when harm occurs) are distributed by AI attribution weights over the on-ledger causal chain—covering executors and materially influential reviewers/acceptors—so “who mattered” is computed from traceable impact, not from titles.

Restoration-first for negative outcomes (Repair beats punishment):
When a reviewed project produces net harm, the system prioritizes launching remedial PSPs, funding them via liable deductions → deposits (if any) → vault buffering → emergency mechanisms when needed. Responsibility is proportional, structural errors are structurally allocated, and Layer 0 survival rights are never revoked.

No retroactive arbitrage (Governance is not a dividend machine):
Participation in review/governance cannot be turned into backdoor perpetual profit. Review-as-service uses low weight + caps + versioning, and cannot claim retroactive windfalls from the rules it helped set.

Learning write-back is mandatory (Failures are upgraded into immunity):
Every negative outcome and every “missed positive” must produce versioned write-backs—risk tags, template fixes, acceptance threshold adjustments, audit policy improvements—so the system becomes harder to fool and less likely to repeat the same mistake.

Under these principles, 9.2.1–9.2.4 specify the exact clauses for:

approved + positive impact,

approved + negative impact,

rejected + later proven positive (active remedy),

rejected + negative (no liability by default). ✅

Chapter 10 | Civilization Resilience, SEF & Fiscal Stabilizers

This chapter defines AEP’s system-level “stability funding circuit”: through normal taxes, scarcity adjustment taxes, and other exit valves, DemandCoin is gently reclaimed from markets and public activity, then dynamically routed—under system pressure—among the Civilization Insurance Vault, the Survival Evolution Fund (SEF), and Burn.

All tax ranges, routing strategies, and thresholds are model-calibrated and versioned-on-ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
10.1 Civilization Stability Pool (CSP)

CSP is the unified collection pool for taxes and systemic fees (it does not flow to counterparties). Its only destinations are:

(a) Resilience Vault: disaster/deflation hedging, remedial projects, systemic risk buffering
(b) SEF: only for Layer 0 upgrades and engineering deployment
(c) Burn: when necessary, retire DemandCoin to offset inflation, supply bottlenecks, and run risk

Any routing ratios and on/off decisions must be versioned on-ledger for traceability/auditability/rollback.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
10.2 Baseline Metabolism Levy (Metabolic Tax)

The Metabolic Tax is the always-on normal tax regime, dynamically floating within a 0.01%–0.05% band, and it never stops.

It applies to two scenarios:

(a) At minting payout: when a public project settles and issues DemandCoin, the system withholds Metabolic Tax at the current rate at issuance.
(b) At Layer 1 settlement: on every market trade / project expenditure / distribution in Layer 1, the system charges Metabolic Tax on the settlement amount at the current rate.

The rate is dynamically calibrated based on SPI (10.4), velocity, supply congestion, delivery latency, and risk signals, and each calibration must be versioned on-ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
10.3 Scarcity Adjustment Levy

Applies to occupation/consumption of public and structurally scarce resources (see Chapter 11 resource dynamic pricing). It suppresses excessive occupation and stabilizes experience-layer prices.

Rates float by band: stronger scarcity, tighter supply, higher run risk → higher rates and higher Burn routing weight; only when supply capacity is ample and Layer 0 upgrade pipeline is deliverable does SEF routing increase.

All thresholds and band adjustments must be versioned on-ledger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
10.4 Macro Stability Control: One Index, Multiple Valves

AEP monitoring is not just observation; it drives executable system adjustments. Macro stability control consists of:

(One index) SPI: System Pressure Index
SPI measures deviation between “money/demand expansion speed” and “real supply / redeemability capacity,” integrating scarcity, delivery latency, price congestion, and anomalous trading signals into a traceable state sequence. SPI triggers and calibrates valves; it adds no new value judgment.

(Multiple valves) Stabilizers

Mint Throttle: without violating minting law, adjusts speed/intensity of new coin entering the market (reward coefficients, confidence thresholds, settlement rhythm, streaming params, pause/resume conditions).

Burn Counterbalance: increases burn weight when bottlenecks/congestion/run risk rises; reduces burn in deflation or supply slack to avoid over-tightening.

SEF Allocation: increases routing to SEF only when Layer 0 upgrade pipeline is deliverable (maturity, marginal cost, supply chain, maintenance capacity); otherwise auto-de-loads.

Idle-Decay & Heat-Fee Linkage: links idle-decay (main valve) and heat friction fee (secondary valve) as additional stabilizers; thresholds/rates/routing are SPI-calibrated and versioned.

Resource Price Anchor: uses Chapter 11 dynamic pricing + public buyback parity to suppress hoarding arbitrage and manipulation.

Every parameter change and model standard update must be versioned into the chain ledger for review, correction, and rollback.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 11 | Resource Commons: Dynamic Pricing, Quotas & Anti-Hoarding

This chapter defines public-reserve nature of natural/public resources, dynamic pricing, anti-hoarding constraints, and project quota systems to ensure sustainable flow between Layer 0 and markets while preventing hoarding from becoming a new hidden monopoly.

11.1 Commons & Anti-Monopoly

Natural resources and key public resources (minerals, land, energy, water, staple food, critical base materials, etc.) belong to the public reserve. Permanent private possession and structural monopoly are prohibited in principle.

Occupation/extraction/use must be auditable and is subject to scarcity levies and quota constraints.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
11.2 Dynamic Pricing with Public Buyback Parity

Resources use dynamic pricing: prices adjust with scarcity, inventory, supply-chain congestion, and ecological constraints, and are versioned on-ledger.

Public Buyback Parity: if an actor buys a resource from the system at price P, then—under the same conditions—the system’s buyback price for that resource is fixed at P (no appreciation/discount due to later market swings). This blocks “hoard → sell back to the system” arbitrage.

Actors may still resell to the free market, but with dynamic replenishment and supply projects, systemic hoarding premiums should be compressed. If abnormal premiums/hoarding signals appear, scarcity levy increases and audit windows may trigger.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
11.3 Purchase Limits & Project Quotas

To prevent unconditional hoarding, the system sets caps on “unconditional purchase volume” by resource category and scarcity—dynamically calibrated and versioned.

Certified free-market projects, reviewed public projects, and PPIPs may apply for project quotas based on real needs. Quota approval and issuance require auditability, use-locking, trace logs, and are subject to sampling and reclaim verification.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
11.4 Forecasted Inventory, Supply Tasks & Recovery

Using forecast models for resource consumption in public affairs and markets, the system manages inventory. When a resource hits thresholds, it launches supply/extraction/planting/restoration public projects; contributors earn DemandCoin by verified output.

Resource recovery is also issued as public projects: for dissolved projects or production residuals, actors may submit recovery requests into auditable recovery → processing → redistribution flows, reducing waste and increasing resilience.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
11.5 R&D and Specialized Use

Complex R&D and specialized public affairs consume material resources: teams must purchase resources with DemandCoin or apply for quotas, following “within capacity, optimize plans, avoid waste.”

For ecological redlines or high-risk materials, the system can raise scarcity levies, tighten quotas, and trigger higher audit intensity.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 12 | Unanticipated Scientific Breakthroughs (Recognition)

When a scientific breakthrough was not pre-launched as a project:

maintainers initiate a recognition PSP

audit and confirm contribution ratios

issue DemandCoin by contribution

When a breakthrough and key technology are confirmed as public-value outcomes and enter the open stage, rewards follow a “three-piece kit”:

Open Grant
Once the tech is openly published under reviewable open conditions (verifiable reproduction, key evidence preserved, clear rights boundaries), the system issues a one-time DemandCoin grant as a direct reward for open contribution. This is not an exclusive-profit right and creates no perpetual dividend.

Micro-Usage Reward
When the open tech is used to deliver verifiable public supply (especially when integrated into Layer 0), the system may trigger extremely small DemandCoin feedback by actual usage volume/service delivery. Must satisfy:

micro: each trigger is tiny to avoid “interest extraction” on basic needs

decay: per-trigger reward decreases as usage scale expands, preventing class solidification

cap: each settlement period has traceable caps, preventing long-term monopoly rents

Attribution on Ledger
Each public supply/service delivery writes to ledger:

which open tech/method it used

provider identity and contributor list

the tech’s contribution ratio in that service (per AI attribution model)

PSA/metric closure and evidence pointers

There is only one currency (DemandCoin); all rewards settle in it; “service act → outcome → attribution ratio” must be on-ledger.

This structure emphasizes “open is contribution, use is feedback,” while micro+decay+cap prevents new perpetual-motion rent.

<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 13 | Pluralism & Modularity: Project Fission, Subprojects & Cycles
13.1 Similar Projects Can Coexist (Non-Competition by Geography)

Similar project types are not forced to merge. Implemented in different places, they are not competitors; they form “solution biodiversity.”
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
13.2 Recursive Sub-project Architecture

Major projects can be decomposed into R&D, manufacturing, execution, observation, logistics, etc., allowing people of different capability levels to participate.
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
13.3 Cyclical Sleep/Wake

After a cyclical task completes, it enters sleep while preserving organization and knowledge base; it automatically wakes in the next cycle or when trigger conditions are met (e.g., migratory season).
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
<br>&nbsp;<br>
Chapter 14 | Minimal Intervention: Ecological Reverence and the Beauty of Non-Action

For ecological projects, the first review is not “how good is the plan,” but proving: why nature cannot self-heal.

If an ecosystem is in balance or intervention risk exceeds natural fluctuation, the project is not approved.

The system also rewards watchers who observe and confirm “no intervention needed,” teaching restraint and reverence.

Fabricating fake needs (destroy then “restore”) is strictly prohibited. Once detected, it triggers top-tier causal reclaim and long-term education.

<br>&nbsp;<br>

Chapter 15 | The End of the System: Civilization’s Coming-of-Age and Protocol Dissolution

AEP is a transitional civilizational ladder.

When humanity matures such that systemic errors no longer arise and we no longer need ledgers to confirm each other’s value, DemandCoin and evaluation mechanisms gradually enter dormancy and ultimately exit history.

Then value circulates as naturally as breathing, and civilization enters a higher stage of self-organization. 🌱

Appendix A | Glossary (Short Version)

AEP Protocol (Act–Energy–Public Protocol):
A socio-economic governance protocol where Public Service Acts are the only source of minting, and Restorative (causal) repair is the only correction mechanism.

Public Affairs / Public Matters:
A set of affairs that generate positive or restorative value for society as a whole, cannot be privately monopolized, and whose benefits/harms can be evaluated and traced.

Public Service Project (PSP):
A system-issued and task-decomposable execution unit of public affairs, including goals, metrics, baselines, timeline, risks, and acceptance rules.

Task / Sub-project:
The smallest executable unit after project decomposition, with explicit inputs/outputs, acceptance conditions, evidence checklist, and time/space fences.

Public Service Act (PSA):
A verifiable real-world service act record that satisfies project acceptance conditions; the only trigger for minting DemandCoin.

DemandCoin:
AEP’s public-value voucher, minted only via PSA; usable for experience-layer exchange and scarce resource consumption; can be burned/reclaimed.

Minting Law (Only-PSA Minting Law):
DemandCoin can only be created from verified PSAs; private trade, speculation/arbitrage, asset holding, and capital gains do not mint new coins.

Chain Ledger:
An immutable chained record structure (isomorphic to blockchain) recording minting, transfers, reclaim/burn, and the causal chain of PSAs.

Irreversible Value Memory:
Coins can be spent or burned, but the underlying contribution/harm record remains forever: “Money can disappear; contribution cannot be erased.”

Evidence Pack:
A standardized package of verification evidence (sensor data, logs, video, signatures, surprise audits, etc.) with hashed proofs.

Physical Causal Verification:
Core PSA validity principle: no output / no measurable change → no minting; acceptance must close the loop with real-world data.

Baseline (Baseline / Base-Spec):
Pre-project predicted natural evolution used to prevent claiming credit for what would happen anyway, and to serve as causal comparison.

Metric Set:
A multi-dimensional vector of metrics (physical, social, resource usage, risk, etc.) used to evaluate benefit/harm.

Confidence Threshold:
Only positive disturbances significantly exceeding baseline noise trigger minting and streaming payments, avoiding noise misclassification.

Control & Noise Cancellation:
Methods to remove external variables (weather, energy price, general tech progress, etc.) from impact judgement.

Attribution:
Distribution of benefit/harm among participants by causal chain and weights, forming reward shares or responsibility shares.

Impact Streaming (Long-tail value flow):
For long-term public impact, beyond a one-time reward, DemandCoin is streamed periodically during an Impact Period; stops when the period ends.

Impact Period:
A defined effective window for long-term impact validity, limiting streaming duration to prevent perpetual dividends.

Reward Shaping:
System dynamically adjusts task rewards by supply/demand: too many participants → lower rewards; shortages → higher rewards.

System Maintainers:
Governance roles responsible for stability domains: identity, infrastructure, justice, public credit, certification, safety, education/healthcare operations, civic mind/mental health, etc.

Human Maintainers:
Maintainers are humans; they have no fixed privileges outside DemandCoin, and serve as accountable managers between AI and public affairs.

AI as Executor:
AI is an execution/computation tool. It may initiate projects in standardized low-conflict domains; irreversible major projects require human participation.

Hard Separation:
Strict boundary between value-source projects (production/creation) and maintenance/operations projects for long-term reward rights.

Production Impact Stream:
Long-term impact stream generated by value-source projects, shared among contributors by contribution ratio.

Maintenance Impact Stream:
When maintenance actions create measurable new public benefits, they form an independent stream with separate attribution and streaming; cannot be mixed into production streams.

Restorative Justice (Causal Repair):
Correction mechanism centered on harm evaluation, causal tracing, proportional responsibility, and remedial projects—not punishment.

Service Debt (Negative DemandCoin balance):
When public service causes harm, DemandCoin is reclaimed proportionally; the account may go negative. Layer 0 survival is unaffected, but access and task priority may be constrained.

Civilization Insurance Vault (Civilization Resilience Vault):
Funded by taxes and part of scarcity-related income; used for remedial projects, risk buffers, systemic disasters, and deflation 대응.

Metabolic Tax (Baseline Metabolism Levy):
Always-on normal tax, dynamically floating within 0.01%–0.05%, applied at minting payout and at every Layer 1 settlement; routed into the stability pool.

Scarcity Adjustment Levy:
Dynamic levy on structural scarce resources (tax band floats); used to suppress over-occupation and stabilize prices; routed among burn/vault/SEF by system pressure.

Burn (Annihilation):
DemandCoin is retired (destroyed) during scarcity consumption and high-tier payments to offset inflation and suppress wealth freezing.

Externality:
Quantifiable impact of market actions on the public system beyond the two counterparties (pollution, public health risk, infrastructure instability, safety events, etc.) whose cost is not fully internalized.

Layer 1 Externality Liability:
AEP’s liability framework for Layer 1: normally no per-transaction review; once harm triggers are met, the system enters causal tracing, responsibility allocation, and remedial PSP closure.

Harm Event:
A system-generated on-ledger event record triggered when key public metrics show significant negative change meeting causal thresholds; used to trigger remedy, audit windows, holds, and attribution.

Risk Tiering (Risk Tiers):
Categorizing Layer 1 behaviors/products by externality risk levels, keeping minimal interference for low risk and raising constraints/audit intensity for high risk.

Strict Liability Backstop:
For extreme risk tiers: “restore first, attribute later.” System can start remedies and temporary restrictions immediately, then complete attribution within an audit window.

Provisional Liability Hold:
Temporary fund/permission controls on disputed gains or highly related actors during audit windows, ensuring remedies can start and preventing further spread; later return/add/transfer by attribution result.

After-the-fact Attribution:
Attribution completed within audit windows after remedies start: allocate harm along causal chain, reclaim DemandCoin, apply credit/permission outcomes, and write back parameters.

Platform Symmetry Rule:
Platforms/intermediaries who earn sustained profits in high-risk categories must bear symmetrical risk-control duties and liability exposure; if harm-event rates exceed thresholds, their default liability weights and constraints rise until risk falls.

Anti-oscillation:
To prevent frequent parameter jumps causing panic and “window arbitrage,” system updates use smoothing/hysteresis/minimum effective periods/rollback, with versioned logging.

Model-calibrated & Versioned-on-ledger Parameters:
Key parameters (risk control, attribution, thresholds, reward shaping) are model-updated from real data; every update must form a traceable version written to the chain ledger.

Balancing & Review:
For major/irreversible projects, formal review is used; review actions can be PSAs and enter the causal chain for reward/liability sharing.

Four Causal Cases:
Rules for outcomes across four cases: approved positive, approved negative, rejected but later proven positive, rejected and later proven negative.

Reasonable Dissent Safe Harbor:
For “rejected but later positive” cases, dissenters are not penalized unless gross negligence/malice; cautious opposition becomes learning samples.

Resource Commons:
A public reserve + inventory supply system for natural resources: forecast demand, issue supply tasks, stockpile/manage, and provide quotas for R&D/specialized use.

Minimal Intervention:
Ecology projects must prove nature cannot self-heal first; observers who confirm “no intervention needed” are rewarded; fake-demand creation is prohibited.

Dissolution:
When civilization no longer needs ledgers to confirm value, DemandCoin and evaluation mechanisms gradually go dormant and exit history.

Appendix B (Engineering) | MVP & Migration Path: System Components & Acceptance Criteria
B.0 Overall Architecture (Minimum Closed Loop)

Minimum viable AEP pilot loop:
Task issuance → task claiming → execution → evidence capture → PSA verification → ledgering/reward → audit/review → parameter write-back.

Core domain models (mandatory unified schema)

Project (PSP): goal, scope, baseline, metrics, cycle, risk tier, permission gates, budget/reward rules

Task: input/output standards, acceptance conditions, required qualifications, evidence checklist, time limit, geo-fence

PSA record: actor, timestamp, evidence hash, metric deltas, verification verdict, causal pointers

Evidence Pack: sensor streams, logs, images, signatures, witness statements, surprise audit results

Baseline: natural evolution forecast + controls + confidence intervals

Attribution: contribution weights, impact window, noise cancellation, statistical significance

Credit Hash: long-run trust score, permission tiers, eligible risk-task range

Audit: random sampling, deep audit, peer review, dispute arbitration

Phase 0 | Ledger-Only (Record contributions, no minting)
0.1 Minimum system components (must-have)

1) ID & Access

unique identity binding (real-name or organization identity internally; public display not required)

permission tiering: participant / certified trade / auditor / maintainer / reviewer

device binding: execution devices, sensors, terminal signatures (prevent “crowd刷记录” attacks)

2) Task Board

task template library (standardized definitions)

publish/withdraw/change with version control (traceable)

geo-fence / time-fence

3) Evidence capture & Evidence Pack

IoT/log ingestion: sensor streams, machine logs, work-order systems, photo/video

packaging: unified format + hash digest + timestamp + signature

minimum evidence checklist: each task family must define must-have evidence

4) PSA Validation Engine

physical causal closure: no output → no PSA

baseline comparison: metric delta must cross thresholds (still no minting yet, but must output verdict)

anti-fraud rules: abnormal frequency, collusion graph clusters, repeated evidence, device fingerprint anomalies

5) Chain Ledger (permissioned)

not public chain; permissioned ledger / tamper-evident audit log is sufficient

records: PSA, evidence hashes, verification verdicts, participants, audit events, rule versions

6) Audit & Review

random sampling (system-driven)

deep-audit triggers (anomaly clusters, mutual approvals, metric overfitting)

dispute submission + arbitration queue (human first, model-upgrade ready)

0.2 Data flow (minimum closed loop)

Publish task → claim → execute → auto evidence capture → PSA verify (pass/reject/need-more-evidence) → write ledger → random sampling/review → parameter updates (thresholds/templates/risk weights)

0.3 Key interfaces (API/events)

POST /projects, POST /tasks

POST /tasks/{id}/claim, POST /tasks/{id}/submit

POST /evidence/ingest (stream/batch)

POST /psa/verify (sync verdict + async audit)

GET /ledger/records?subject=...

POST /dispute, POST /audit/trigger

0.4 Phase gate metrics

PSA reject rate, “need-more-evidence” rate, sampled fraud-hit rate should stabilize and trend down

per-PSA verification cost (compute + human) stays bounded

“no output → no ledgering (valid PSA)” rule holds without exception

Phase 1 | Voucher Layer (Issue vouchers, not DemandCoin)
1.1 Added components (on top of Phase 0)

1) Voucher Engine

voucher types: redeem-only catalog (public services/experience/queue priority)

non-transferable or weakly transferable; default no secondary trading

redemption integration with providers

2) Supply Catalog

redeemable resource pools: venue timeslots, courses, transit upgrades, checkups, etc.

capacity constraints: supply caps + (optional) dynamic pricing; at minimum, hard capacity caps

3) Anti-arbitrage / Anti-black-market

abnormal redemption graph (one person many vouchers, one voucher many attempts, collusion redemption)

voucher expiry/freeze/rollback (voucher-only; does not touch survival base)

1.2 Gate metrics

participation/retention/completion improves

black-market / resale rate is suppressible

provider complaint rates and queue pressure remain controllable

Phase 2 | DemandCoin Closed Loop (Closed internal circulation)
2.1 Added components (on top of Phase 1)

1) Mint & Burn Core

minting only after PSA passes (Minting Law)

burn on scarce resources / high-tier experiences

metabolic tax online inside pilot (even fixed tiny rate first, to validate the pipe)

2) Reward Shaping Engine

inputs: task supply/demand, participant counts, time-to-complete, failure rate, risk tier

outputs: reward weight updates + eligibility gate suggestions

anti-oscillation: smoothing/hysteresis to prevent “today high, tomorrow crash” exploitation

3) Wallet & Settlement

internal wallet (no external chain integration)

trade limits: quota/frequency/blacklists (anti-speculation)

ledger reconciliation: wallet balances must be derivable or auditable from ledger

4) Minimal Balancer Module (Review & balancing)

review only for high-risk/irreversible/cross-cycle big projects

review enters causal chain: signature implies future reward/liability exposure

apply “Reasonable Dissent Safe Harbor” as in the main text

2.2 Gate metrics

inflation/deflation: volatility between coin volume and redeemable supply is controllable

reward shaping works: shortage tasks fill faster

speculation signs (short-cycle flipping, task-board manipulation) are suppressible

Phase 3 | Partial Layer 0 (Local survival-stack module pilot)
3.1 Added components

1) Quota & Entitlement

identity-bound base quota per person per period (food/transit/basic medical modules)

over-quota charging: marginal cost increases (pay in DemandCoin)

anti-abuse: abnormal consumption curves trigger audits (but never remove base quota)

2) Supply Orchestration

inventory forecasting + dispatch: engineering the resource commons (warehousing, delivery, replenishment)

provider interfaces: real-world suppliers (gov/enterprises/coops)

3) Resilience & Emergency

disaster mode: rationing strategy under inventory shortage

deflation emergency minting / voucher substitution (only for remedies and critical supply)

3.2 Gate metrics

base quota supply stays stable (no collapse)

abuse rate is controllable without harming normal users

over-quota pricing actually suppresses waste

Phase 4 | Larger-scale Integration

This phase is no longer “components go live,” but institutional interfaces: cross-region settlement, legal recognition, public resource governance refactoring.

You’ll need long-run Phase 0–3 data to produce an auditable social experiment report—without that, you can’t safely push full integration.
Phase 4 | Resource Commons & Innovation Boundary Expansion: Dynamic Pricing, Anti-Hoarding, PPIP, and Recusal

Goal: Engineer Chapter 11 and the free-market–Layer 0 innovation boundary into deployable mechanisms: dynamic resource pricing, public buyback parity, quota systems, PPIP, and maintainer recusal rules.

4.1 New Components

Dynamic resource pricing + Public Buyback Parity (Public Buyback Parity)
Resource prices adjust dynamically with scarcity / inventory / congestion and are versioned on-ledger.
The system buyback price offered to any entity equals that entity’s original purchase price, blocking “hoard → resell back to the system” arbitrage. Abnormal hoarding triggers tax increases and an audit window.

Project quota system (Project Quotas)
Individuals/enterprises face unconditional purchase caps. Certified free-market projects, reviewed public projects, and PPIPs may apply for higher quotas (use-case locking + full trace logs + random sampling audits + recovery/verification of returned resources).

Minimal PPIP implementation (Public–Private Integrated Projects)
Distinguish: (i) technology transfer/licensing vs (ii) co-development collaboration.
Information-isolated decomposition: the master agreement may remain confidential, but subprojects must be auditable and traceable.
Reward schemes can support both lump-sum and usage-based (per-use/per-unit) payouts (dynamically calibrated and versioned on-ledger). After the exclusivity period ends, the technology enters public upgrade status and no longer accrues profit-sharing.

Maintainer-owned enterprise recusal mechanism (Conflict-of-Interest & Recusal)
Maintainers must not, in the name of the public, privately cooperate with enterprises owned/controlled by themselves or other maintainers. Such cooperation must be converted into a public service project with open recruitment. “Senior-council governance / clique formation” is prohibited.

4.2 Phase 4 Acceptance Criteria

Resource-hoarding arbitrage is systemically compressed (public buyback parity works; abnormal premium signals trigger correctly).

PPIP can mobilize social execution capacity without leaking secrets (decomposition + audits are workable).

Recusal mechanisms are enforceable: related-party transactions automatically convert into open recruitment and are auditable; violations can trigger circuit breakers and responsibility-chain consequences.

Phase 5 | Cross-Regional Scaling & Institutional Interfaces (Full Integration)

Goal: Move from “engineering pilots” to “institutional interfaces”: cross-regional settlement, judicial recognition, and restructuring of public resource governance.

Hard prerequisite: Obtain long-run data from Phases 0–4 and produce an auditable social experiment report—cheating rates, false-positive/false-negative harm, supply stability, dispute-resolution throughput, dual-track model upgrade behavior, and macro-stabilizer effectiveness—each reviewable, accountable, and rollback-capable.
